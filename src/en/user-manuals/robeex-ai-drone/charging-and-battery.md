## 🚨 Battery Warnings During Flight

::: tip
Before every flight, make sure the battery is **fully charged** using the provided charger and cable.
:::

::: warning
#### 🔋Low Battery Warning & Haptic Feedback:

* **⚠️ 30% Charge (Alert):** When the battery level drops to **30%**, the connected mobile device or tablet will provide **slow haptic (vibration) feedback**. This is your primary alert to **promptly land the aircraft** to prevent further power loss and an uncontrolled descent.
* **🚨 <15% Charge (CRITICAL):** When the battery level is **below 15%**, the haptic feedback will become **intense**, signaling a **critical low battery state** and requiring **immediate landing**.
:::
