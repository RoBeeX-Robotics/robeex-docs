# Introduction to RoBeeX Blockly Environment

In this section you will get familiar with RoBeeX Blockly Environment

<!-- # 🧩 Writing your first Blockly program

This short guide walks you through creating a simple, working Blockly program for your RoBeeX device. You'll learn how to open the editor, assemble blocks, run the program, and troubleshoot common issues.

What you'll build: a repeating LED sequence that changes color and pauses — a friendly, visible way to confirm the device is responding to your program. -->

## Prerequisites

- [Installing RoBeeX App on your computer / mobile phone](../../../user-manuals/robeex-ai-drone/install-application)
- A RoBeeX device powered on and connected to your computer / mobile phone

If you don't yet have a device connection, you can still follow the steps in the editor and run them later when a device is available.

::: tip
You can run blockly programs without being connect to the device, in cases where your not using device related blocks (Flight, LEDs and etc)
