# 👨🏻 Face Tracking Program (Blockly Demo)

This Blockly program is designed to instruct a drone to perform the following actions:

* **Initial Ascent:** The drone will first fly up and maintain a stable altitude of **150 cm** (centimeters).
* **Face Tracking:** Once at the target altitude, the drone will continuously attempt to track any human face it detects.
* **Centering Mechanism:** To keep the detected face within the **center** of its image frame, the drone uses **yaw** movement (rotation around its vertical axis) to adjust its orientation.
