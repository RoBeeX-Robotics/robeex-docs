## Propeller Installation

Before flight, make sure that each **propeller** is installed on the **correct motor**, matching its **spin direction** (CW or CCW).  

::: warning
The **CW and CCW** propellers must be mounted on their compatible motors, matching the direction of spin for proper operation.
:::
::: warning
Ensure the propeller hub is fully seated on the motor shaft until the end of the shaft is visible (or flush) with the top of the hub.
:::


::: tip
Follow the **arrow directions shown on the RoBeeX main board near the rubber dampers** to identify each motor’s rotation direction.

## Motor Spin Directions

- **Motors M1 and M3** rotate **Counter Clockwise (CCW)**  
  → Install the **CCW propeller** on these motors.

- **Motors M2 and M4** rotate **Clockwise (CW)**  
  → Install the **CW propeller** on these motors.

::: warning
Double-check that each propeller matches its motor’s rotation direction before flight — installing them incorrectly can prevent the drone from taking off or cause instability.
:::

::: danger
Failure to fully seat the propeller on the motor shaft, allowing the shaft to pass completely through the hub, risks propeller ejection during flight.
